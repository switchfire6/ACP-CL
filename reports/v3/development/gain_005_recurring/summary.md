# Exploratory experiment results

Evaluation split: **validation**. Values below are percentages or percentage points.
These runs test implementation and generate hypotheses; they are not confirmatory evidence.

| Method | Seeds | Final accuracy | Forgetting | Late early AUC | Scratch-adjusted AUC | Seconds/run |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| recycle_v3 | 2 | 40.17 | 6.10 | 34.10 | — | 63.5 |

Lower forgetting is better; higher accuracy and acquisition AUC are better.
Methods with oracle boundaries or offline yoked traces are extra-information diagnostics, not task-free competitors.
Scratch-adjusted AUC subtracts a fresh model's AUC on the identical experience; it is a diagnostic, not pure transfer.
Timing includes evaluation, diagnostics, and checkpoint writes. It is not a matched-compute comparison.
The recycling and DER++ comparators are explicitly documented implementation variants.
